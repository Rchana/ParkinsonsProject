# ParkinsonsProject
Detection of freezing of gate during walking, that triggers sensor output through Arduino interface 

## Group Members:
- Arrchana (Detection algorithm, Arduino & MATLAB interface)
- Zoe (Detection algorithm, Arduino & MATLAB interface)
- Laura (Circuit design & Arduino Interface)
- Daphne (Software Architecture)
- Charly (Prototype design & hardware integration)

## What's in the repo:
- "Hardware & prototype" = pictures of our design
- "Signal detection" = the original signal detection algorithm created on matlab
- "arduinoSignalDetection" = the final code required to run the project independently on the arduino
- "debugging buzzer music" = music created to play on our buzzer while we were busy at works... just for giggles
