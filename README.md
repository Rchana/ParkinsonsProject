# ParkinsonsProject
A device that detects freezing of gate (shuffled walking) patterns using real-time accelerometer data and a novel algorithm. If the algorithm detects FOG, a motor is triggered to apply a vibrating stimulus to the muscles to alleviate pain.

## Group Members:
- Arrchana (Detection algorithm, signal analysis, MATLAB to Arduino conversion)
- Zoe (Detection algorithm, MATLAB to Arduino conversion)
- Laura (Circuit design & Arduino hardware interface)
- Daphne (Software Architecture, LaTex master)
- Charly (Prototype design, hardware design analysis)

## What's in the repo:
- "Documentation" = a folder containing a presentation, design analysis, and required files to update LaTex documentation
- "Process work" = a bunch of subfolders containing all files involved in the development of the final design contained in "arduinoSignalDetection"
- "arduinoSignalDetection" = code required to run the project independently on the Arduino
